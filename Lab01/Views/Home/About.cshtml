<h2>Giới thiệu về ASP.NET MVC 5</h2>
<p>
    This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend you try the Razor Pages tutorial before the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

    Is easier to follow.
    Covers more features.
    Is the preferred approach for new app development.
